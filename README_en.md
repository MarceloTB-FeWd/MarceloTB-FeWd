# 👋 Hello, I'm @MarceloTB-FeWd

I am a beginner in programming, currently focusing on front-end web development. 
I am gradually learning the fundamentals of website creation and constructing small projects to gain experience and apply what I know.

🛠️ Sure, here is the revised text:

**Technologies and Tools in Learning**  
- HTML5 and CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Version control with Git and GitHub  
- First steps with frameworks and web best practices  
- Interest in TypeScript, React, Node.js, and SQL  

🌱 **Current Focus**  
I am starting my learning journey by studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am exploring how these elements combine to create a website's structure, style, and functionality. 
Additionally, I am practicing with simple pages and learning concepts such as layout, responsiveness, and user interaction.

🎯 **Future Plans**  
As I progress in my studies, I plan to delve into the back-end area to understand the logic behind web applications. 
I am interested in working with relational and non-relational databases to develop more comprehensive and dynamic projects.

✨ **About Me**  
Effort, discipline, and organization help me focus on my studies to turn ideas into visual projects. Every new learning experience is an exciting step, and programming 
is a powerful tool for problem-solving and creating new possibilities. It's a profession worth transitioning to, although that depends on each person. However, I see programming as a very accessible field.

👀 you on the other side!
