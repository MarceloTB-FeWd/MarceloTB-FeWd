# 👋 Hello, I'm @MarceloTB-FeWd

I am a beginner in programming, currently focused on front-end web development. 
I am learning the basics of website creation step by step and building small projects to gain experience and practice what I learn.

🛠️ **Technologies and Tools in Learning**  
- HTML5 and CSS3  
- JavaScript  
- Version control with Git and GitHub  
- First steps with frameworks and web best practices  
- Interest in TypeScript, React, Node.js, and SQL  

🌱 **What am I studying now?**  
I am currently at the beginning of my journey, learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I am exploring how these elements connect to form the structure, style, and functionality of a website. Additionally, 
I am practicing with simple pages and learning concepts such as layout, responsiveness, and user interaction.

🎯 **Future Plans**  
As I advance in my studies, I plan to explore the back-end area to understand the logic behind web applications. 
I am interested in working with the integration of relational and non-relational databases to develop more complete and dynamic projects.

✨ **About Me**  
Effort, discipline, and organization help me stay focused on my studies to transform ideas into visual projects. 
Every new learning experience is an exciting step, and I believe programming is a powerful tool not only for solving problems 
but also for creating new possibilities. Perhaps it's a profession worth migrating to, although that depends on each person. 
However, I see programming as a very democratic field.

👀 you on the other side!
