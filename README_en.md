🌱 **Current Focus** 

I'm starting my learning journey by studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I'm exploring how these elements combine to create a website's structure, style, and functionality. 
Additionally, I'm practicing with simple pages and learning concepts such as layout, responsiveness, and user interaction.

🎯 **Future Plans**  

As I progress in my studies, I plan to delve into the back-end area to understand the logic behind web applications. 
I'm interested in working with relational and non-relational databases to develop more comprehensive and dynamic projects.
